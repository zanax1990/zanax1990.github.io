# Jahanbakhsh Ghasemi

I am a second-year **Ph.D. student in Computer Science & Engineering** at the **University of Connecticut (UConn)**. My research focuses on **Applied Machine Learning and Deep Learning**, bridging the gap between computational methods and real-world applications in **biomechanics, biomedical imaging, and microscopy**.

Currently, I am a Graduate Research Assistant collaborating with multiple labs at UConn and UConn Health, including Dr. Cato T. Laurencin, Dr. Kristin Morgan, Dr. Ji Yu, and Dr. Royce Mohan.

I hold a GPA of **3.78** and have successfully passed my Qualifying Exam.
