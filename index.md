I am a second-year **Ph.D. student in Computer Science & Engineering** at the **University of Connecticut (UConn)**. My research focuses on Machine learning and computer vision for large-scale biomedical and biomechanical systems, with
emphasis on scalable experimentation using high-performance computing (HPC). Core interests
include image segmentation, representation learning, semi-supervised learning, and data-driven
surrogate modeling for computationally expensive scientific pipelines.

Currently, I serve as a Graduate Research Assistant at the University of Connecticut (UConn), contributing to data-driven biomechanics and machine learning projects in collaboration with research teams across UConn and UConn Health. GPA: <strong>3.8</strong>. Qualifying Exam: passed.

✖ Selected Projects

**Machine Learning for Biomechanics**  
_Developed machine learning models (Regression, SVR, Decision Trees, Random Forests, MLPs) to predict knee joint and muscle forces. Applied PCA and Neighborhood Component Analysis for dimensionality reduction, evaluated cross-subject generalization using RMSE, MAE, and R², and analyzed accuracy-latency-scalability trade-offs. Led to a first-author manuscript under review (npj Digital Medicine) and a review manuscript submitted to Communications AI._

**Microscopy and Probabilistic Segmentation**  
_Conducted large-scale microscopy image segmentation using CPU/GPU HPC clusters. Reproduced deterministic baselines, implemented standardized evaluation metrics (Precision, Recall, F1, Dice, AP), and developed probabilistic workflows to assess robustness and diversity. Automated CSV-based metric aggregation and generation of publication-quality figures. Manuscript in preparation._

**HPC Automation and Scientific Data Post-Processing**  
_Developed Python-based automation pipelines for HPC job submission and post-processing of large-scale molecular dynamics trajectories and imaging datasets. Performed spatial and statistical analyses and organized reproducible tables, figures, and summaries for collaborative research._
